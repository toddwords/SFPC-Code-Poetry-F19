### Homework 
1. Create a text generator. The generator can be a twitter bot, a glitch page or something else. You can use tracery or markov, or another method. The generator should be more about the process, and the stream of output rather than any particular result. 

2. Collaborate with a computer program to produce a text. The terms of the collaboration are up to you: you can curate the output of a generator, algorithmically process your own writing, use predictive text or another method of your  Print out the text or an excerpt form it (250-word max) and bring to next class. Be prepared to read it out loud. 

3. Bring in some sound files (preferably mp3) to work with next week as we create language+sound instruments. Instrumental music and sound effects / samples generally work well.


## Day 2 (10/17) Text, Sound and Interactivity

We will start class with a reading of some of our prepared texts and a look at some student generators, then dive into working with sound and interactivity.

### Prompt / Challenge
- Create a language+sound instrument / interactive piece using your own writing. How does your experience of the text change moving through it this way? What does it mean to 'jam' with language? This isn't homework as you'll be starting with a new teacher next week, just a prompt to keep you going
- Present something at [WordHack](https://withfriends.co/event/2760484/wordhack_w_anastasis_germanidis_blair_simmons_and_bryce_wilner) on the Open Projector (5 minute presentation). You can show a generator, read a text, or if you're feeling gutsy do a little performance on the poetry instrument you made today. Also whether you present or not, WordHack is a great show / community for language+technology work so I hope you can all attend if you're free!
