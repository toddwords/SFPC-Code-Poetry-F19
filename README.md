### Homework 
1. Create a text generator. The generator can be a twitter bot, a glitch page or something else. You can use tracery or markov, or another method. The generator should be more about the process, and the stream of output rather than any particular result. 

2. Collaborate with a computer program to produce a text. The terms of the collaboration are up to you: you can curate the output of a generator, algorithmically process your own writing, use predictive text or another method of your  Print out the text or an excerpt form it (250-word max) and bring to next class. Be prepared to read it out loud. 

3. Bring in some sound files (preferably mp3) to work with next week as we create language+sound instruments. Instrumental music and sound effects / samples generally work well.
